About the Authors
=================

[**Magdalena Fuentes**](https://magdalenafuentes.github.io) is an Assistant Professor at the Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL) and the Integrated Design and Media (IDM) Program at New York University (NYU), affiliated with both the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and Tandon School of Engineering. Previously, she was a Provost Postdoctoral Fellow at NYU’s Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) and MARL. She completed her Ph.D. in Image and Signal Processing at Université Paris-Saclay, and a B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering from Universidad de la República, Uruguay. Her research focuses on machine listening—a field at the intersection of signal processing and machine learning—where she develops models for understanding natural and everyday sounds, music, and multimodal data. Magdalena is actively involved with the IEEE Audio and Acoustic Signal Processing Technical Committee and regularly serves as an Area Chair/Meta-reviewer for ICASSP and ISMIR. She has held Program Chair roles for DCASE 2021, 2023, and 2025, as well as ISMIR 2025. Her research has been sponsored by NYU, Google and the NIH.
