## Inspiration
From an aesthetic and structural point of view this online book
owes a huge debt of gratitude to the amazing example set by the ISMIR 2020
tutorial on [`Open Source Tools & Data for Music Source Separation`](https://source-separation.github.io/tutorial/landing.html)

So special thanks Ethan, Prem, and Justin!
