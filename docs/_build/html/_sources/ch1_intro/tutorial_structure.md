### Tutorial Structure and Setup

```{note}
This section draws extensively from the ISMIR 2021 tutorial:
[`Tempo, Beat, and Downbeat Estimation`](https://tempobeatdownbeat.github.io/tutorial/intro.html).
```

## Prerequisites

Regarding **prerequisites**, some familiarity with running Python notebooks is recommended. However, it should also be possible to follow along by simply clicking through the examples. We've designed the tutorial to start with a light, non-technical introduction, followed by a discussion of key theoretical concepts related to deep learning approaches for rhythm analysis. The hands-on component forms the core of the tutorial.
