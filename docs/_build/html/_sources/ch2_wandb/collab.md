# Collab and Python Lightening

We will use Google Colab and PyTorch Lightening given their 

## **1. Google Colab**
Google Colab is a free cloud-based platform that lets you write and execute Python code in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It's perfect for collaborative coding, and you get access to free GPUs and TPUs for training models.

### **Key Features**
- **Free GPUs/TPUs:** Speed up computation-heavy tasks.
- **Collaboration:** Share notebooks with team members in real-time.
- **Pre-installed Libraries:** Comes with many popular Python libraries.
- **Integration:** Easily integrates with Google Drive for saving and accessing files.

## **2. Python Lightning**
Python Lightning (or PyTorch Lightning) is a high-level framework for PyTorch that simplifies building and scaling machine learning models. It abstracts the boilerplate code and provides a structure for reproducible and scalable experiments.

### **Key Features**
- **Modularity:** Separate data loading, model definition, and training loops.
- **Scalability:** Run on CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, or clusters with minimal changes.
- **Logging and Callbacks:** Built-in support for logging with TensorBoard and other tools.
- **Community Plugins:** Leverage Lightningâ€™s rich plugin ecosystem for distributed training, pruning, and more.

### **How to Get Started**
1. Install Lightning:
   ```bash
   pip install lightning
